- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, My name is Fikri Wahidin. I come from Banjar Regency, in the province of South Kalimantan. Now I'm Studying at Telkom University Bandung. 
I decided to continue my undergraduate education at Telkom University with the Informatics Study Program as the first choice. 
I chose the Informatics Study Program due to continuing my major in high school. 
I am very interested in Programming, Computing Systems, and Computer Logic Processes. 
I hope to improve my computer skills, and troubleshooting problems that occur. 
I hope I can use my knowledge to the fullest for the development of technology in Indonesia.
